# High-Performance Data Platform Optimization

## Project Overview
Led the modernization of the data platform at Mercateam, achieving significant performance improvements through optimized data architecture and modern data engineering practices.

## Key Achievements
- Reduced data processing time from 1 hour to under 10 seconds
- Implemented efficient CDC (Change Data Capture) between PostgreSQL and BigQuery using DataStream
- Migrated and optimized data transformations using DBT
- Formalized infrastructure with Terraform for better maintainability

## Technical Implementation
- Configured and optimized CDC pipeline between PostgreSQL and BigQuery
- Implemented data transformations using DBT best practices
- Set up infrastructure as code using Terraform
- Established monitoring and optimization practices

## Technologies Used
- PostgreSQL for source database
- Google BigQuery for data warehouse
- DataStream for CDC implementation
- DBT for data transformations
- Terraform for infrastructure management
